# woah, it's rex
This is a 2D browser version of a 3D idle mining game on Roblox called REx:R.

This is an unofficial version of amber's original project to make the code more readable and less messy, as well as implementing more QoL features that I felt the base game needed (and many UI fixes).

# TODO List

  - Probably a performance issue that can be solved with optimizing code
  - fixed?? maybe???
- [ ] Fix latest spawns not displaying when it should be ??? \[medium priority\]
- [ ] Fix index completion highlighting on ores themselves (only doesn't work for some ores)
- [ ] Replace my `overflow-y: scroll;` stuff with `overflow: clip;` to better get rid of scrollbars

## New features

- [x] Add reset count to ore tracker logs
- [ ] Color spawned messages based on whether the player mined it or not
- [ ] Make the spawn/find messages into grids
- [x] Implement unaffectedByLuck (ores that are unaffected by luck)
- [ ] Abbreviate probabilities for screen space
- [ ] Arrange the on-screen controls in a d-pad configuration
- [x] Add a dedicated "reset game" button
- [x] Add the main layer ore next to the teleport meter display button thing
  - [ ] Center the emoji somehow

## Misc.
- [x] Update to latest
- [ ] Combine gear and pickaxe crafting methods \[low priority\]
- [x] Make the layer variables arrays again with probability being stored in orelist
- [ ] Rename all "block"s to "ore"?
- [x] Add margins back to the craft buttons
- [ ] Add a web worker so music doesn't have to keep the page active
- [x] Add a readme
- [ ] Move TODO to a github tracking thing
- [ ] Move lots of initialized variables to a separate file to reduce clutter
- [x] Clean up the code in the scary pickaxe ability functions...
- [ ] Add a list of features exclusive to this fork
- [x] Scale all probability things
- [ ] Add a better system for layer management (variable-wise) (make it a class maybe?)
- [ ] Somehow shift the game icon down by three pixels without increasing the filesize
  - replaced the icon (to differentiate between amber's version and my version) so I don't think I need to do this one yet
- [ ] Combine data-old.js with data.js (using `data["version"]` to differentiate the different save files)
- [ ] Make a dev branch and have testable dev builds deploy at `https://spiritaxolotl.github.io/woah-its-rex/dev` or something
- [ ] Add some sort of symmetry function to eliminate repetitive code (for pickaxe abilities)
- [ ] Set up webhook on discord to post whatever activity goes on in the repository
  - Test 1
